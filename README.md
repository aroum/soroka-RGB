# soroka RGB - DIY-Friendly 40% keyboard

![](build_guides/pics/soroka.jpg)

This is a fork of the [Soroka](https://github.com/kapee1/soroka/) project with added support for the RP2040-Zero-matrix. The only modifications are to the spacer (v2), which includes a cutout to improve the viewing angle, and the addition of two optional pads on the board (v2). However, you can also use the original files with minor adjustmentsâ€”see the Build Guide for more details.
